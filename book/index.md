# 2i2c KPIs

This is a lightweight website to visualize some of 2i2c's Key Performance Indicators.
Its goal is to quickly let us look at the most important numbers to gauge the health and impact of our organization.

These dashboards are generated with [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org) and the [MyST Markdown stack](https://myst.tools).
These are tools from the [ExecutableBooks project](https://executablebooks.org), one of 2i2c's key upstream communities.

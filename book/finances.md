# Revenue projections

This document shows 2i2c's revenue projections by contract, and predicts 2i2c's monthly income along with its costs using data from our [Opportunities AirTable](https://airtable.com/appbjBTRIbgRiElkr/tblBTPDI1nKoq8wOL/viwuJxmlTnW1VZxIm?blocks=hide).

When built via Jupyter Book, all opportunities are anonymized.
If you want de-anonymized opportunities, run the notebook locally.

:::{admonition} To run this notebook locally
:class: dropdown
To see the visualizations locally, follow these steps:

1. Get an API key for AirTable (see [our team compass docs on AirTable](https://compass.2i2c.org/administration/airtable/)) and store it in an environment variable called `AIRTABLE_AP_KEY`.
2. Download the latest data:

   ```bash
   python book/scripts/download_airtable_data.py
   ```
3. Run this notebook from top to bottom.

There are several important fields in both {kbd}`opportunities` and {kbd}`Contracts`, they're described below:

- {kbd}`Start Date` / {kbd}`End Date`: The starting and ending date of a contract.
- {kbd}`Amount`: The total budget amount in the grant.
- {kbd}`Amount for 2i2c`: The budget that is available to 2i2c (if <100% of the amount total)
- {kbd}`CSS %`: The % that CS&S will take for their indirect costs.
:::

:::{admonition} How numbers are prioritized
:class: dropdown
This notebook tries to use the _most accurate data that we've got_.
For example, contracts are usually more accurate than opportunities.
For data about dates and $$ amounts, here's the logic we follow:

1. {kbd}`Amount (from Contract)`. If we have a contract with CS&S for this Lead, use this.
2. {kbd}`Amount (from Opportunities)`. If we have no contract, use our opportunities airtable for a best estimate.

## Costs

Costs are manually calculated for now from [this Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OpKfPSIiFTY28OkV6--MhZygvdLVSdmpagjlnge2ELc/edit?usp=sharing). These **exclude our Fiscal Sponsor Fee** (because this fee is already subtracted from revenue projections below).

## Revenue

[Our Opportunities AirTable](https://airtable.com/appbjBTRIbgRiElkr/tblBTPDI1nKoq8wOL/viwuJxmlTnW1VZxIm?blocks=hide) has all of our potential sources of revenue, as well as links to any contracts for opportunities we have won. The view linked above is the source of data for this page.

Opportunities are broken into two stages:

```{list-table}
- * **Opportunities**
  * [link to AirTable](https://airtable.com/appbjBTRIbgRiElkr/tblBTPDI1nKoq8wOL/viwcsrE83taP6GhSl?blocks=hide)
  * Potential sources of revenue. Each has a % probability of success. When an opportunity is "won", it gets a contract and we stop treating it as an opportunity.
- * **Contracts**
  * [link to AirTable](https://airtable.com/appbjBTRIbgRiElkr/tbliwB70vYg3hlkb1/viwGdDgmTcxfnsRDC?blocks=hide)
  * Legal agreements with a total value, start, and stop date. Revenue is treated as 100% reliable.
```

Opportunities are broken into two categories.

```{list-table}
- * **Giving**
  * Financial contributions given to support our mission without expectation of direct material benefit to the donor.
- * **Services**
  * Income generated through services we provide in exchange for payment.
```

````{admonition} Expected total amounts
:class: dropdown

We add a column for the *weighted* total amount to account for the fact that the opportunity may not come through.
This helps us calculate the _total expected amount of revenue_:

`total expected amount` = `opportunity total amounts` * `probability of each opportunity being won`

or if you're a mathy person:

```{math}

E \left[ \sum(opportunities) \right] = \sum_{1}^{n\_opportunities} opportunity\_total * opportunity\_probability = \sum \left( E[opportunities] \right)

```
````


````{admonition} We amortize total amounts over months
:class: dropdown

We spread the total revenue for an opportunity/contract into equal monthly amounts over the total lifetime of the contract.
````

## Budget projections

The following plots show our revenue projections under different sets of assumptions. They go 12 months into the future.
There are three key figures, described below.

1. Our **weighted projected revenue** where opportunity totals are weighted by their expected probability.
2. Our **committed revenue** which only includes opportunities with an active contract or awaiting contracting.
3. Our **best-case scenario total revenue** which reflects revenue if every lead is successful.
